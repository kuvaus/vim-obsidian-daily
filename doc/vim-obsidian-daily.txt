vim-obsidian-daily.vim

A VIM Plugin to make a daily note in the obsidian vault
By default it creates a Daily folder inside the vault if it does not exist
and then creates a empty daily note with a name: YYYY-MM-DD.md 

By default it gets the path of the first vault from Obsidian preferences
You can override this by setting $OBSIDIAN_PATH environment variable or with options

OPTIONS:

g:vault_path = path for your obsidian vault (optional)

g:daily_folder = 'Daily' path for the daily notes inside the vault

g:use_daily_folder = 1 use the above folder instead of direct path

g:use_wsl = 0 put this to 1 if you are running vim on wsl on windows
